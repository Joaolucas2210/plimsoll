# Roadmap

Each phase ends with `scripts/gates.sh` green and the invariant intact:
*the query fails, the node doesn't.*

## Phase 0 — Foundations

- [x] Cargo workspace, crate boundaries (core / connectors / control / server)
- [x] `CeilingPool`: process-wide memory ceiling (ADR 0003)
- [x] Server with `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/healthz`, `/metrics`, graceful shutdown
- [x] ADRs 0001–0004, quality gates script with architecture checks

## Phase 1 — Local read path under the pool

- [x] Engine façade in `plimsoll-core`: `SessionContext` built on `CeilingPool`, result buffers in the Output slice
- [x] Wire `QueryEngine` in the server to the façade
- [x] Parquet scans from local/object storage under the ceiling, spill enabled (S3 via ADR 0009)
- [x] Iceberg table reads (metadata → manifests → Parquet) under the ceiling (ADR 0007)
- [x] Test: a query exceeding the ceiling fails with `memory_limit_exceeded`
      and the next query on the same node succeeds (concurrent variant: TODO)

## Phase 2 — Postgres federation

- [x] Postgres connector as a `TableProvider` in `plimsoll-connectors`
- [x] `PushdownPolicy`: which predicates/projections/limits may be pushed (ADR 0006)
- [x] `FilterGuard`: re-apply filters locally when pushdown semantics differ
      (collation, NULLs, types) — correctness over speed (ADR 0005)
- [ ] Connector buffers accounted against the ceiling

## Phase 3 — Control plane

- [x] Iceberg REST catalog contract + in-memory implementation (`plimsoll-control::catalog`)
- [x] HTTP implementation of the catalog client (Polaris), `reqwest` + rustls (ADR 0008)
- [x] Catalog namespaces as schemas; tables resolved per query (fresh snapshots)
- [x] Catalog-vended storage credentials, scoped per table (ADR 0009)
- [x] Admission: running/queued limits globally, per resource group, per user (RAII slots)
- [x] Query registry + per-query deadline (queue wait + execution)
- [x] `system.runtime.queries` schema + snapshot source
- [x] Expose `system.runtime.queries` as a DataFusion table (server)
- [x] Metrics: pool used/limit, spill bytes, running/queued, totals by state
- [x] Wire pool/spill metrics to the live `CeilingPool`

## Next obvious PR

**Manifest pruning**: skip manifests by partition summaries and data files
by column bounds before opening them, so selective queries on large tables
read (and reserve) only what they need. Then delete-file support (ADR 0007).

## Later

- OTLP traces and metrics export (OpenTelemetry), query-level spans
  (admission wait, planning, execution). No OpenTelemetry dependency until then.
- Query latency histograms in `/metrics`.
- Configurable resource groups (per-group limits from config).
- Authentication (bearer / mTLS) deriving `user` from the principal.
- Readiness drain delay before closing the listener.
- Per-layer governance on the medallion namespaces (`bronze`/`silver`/`gold`).
- Coordinator/worker split along the existing plane boundary.
